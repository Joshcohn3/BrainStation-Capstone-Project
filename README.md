# BrainStation-Capstone-Project
Utilized Tensorflow Software and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud to design a Convolutional Neural Network for the computer vision classification of cancer in 5,202 mammography images.

Capstone Project - Mammography Cancer Classification

Joshua Cohn
BrainStation Data Science Bootcamp

Notebook 1 - mini-DDSM Data Management (https://ardisdataset.github.io/MiniDDSM/)
The mini-Digital Database of Screening Management was explored and analysed in python.

Notebook 2 - Chinese Mammography Dataset Data Management (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tommyngx/cmmd2022)
The Chinese Mammography Dataset was explored and chosen for modeling using image processing.

Notebook 3 - CMMD Data Classification Modeling
The Chinese Mammography Dataset was used to train a Mixed Convolutional Neural Network in the classification
of cancer from 5202 mammography images.
